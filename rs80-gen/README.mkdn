# 8080 instruction set code generation

This crate is used at build time to consume the `isa-ops.txt` and produce Rust
code.

The generated Rust code would be quite tedious to author and maintain by hand:
it contains functions to both disassemble and (separately) emulate each of the
256 possible 8-bit opcodes. Instead, the input file contains 59 instruction
definitions which are processed and specialized.
